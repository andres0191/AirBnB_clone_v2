# FLASK

Currently there are many options to create web pages and many languages ​​(PHP, JAVA), and in this case Flask allows us to create web applications with Python in a very simple way.

Vial is a "micro" framework written in Python and conceived to facilitate the development of Web Applications under the MVC pattern.

The word "micro" does not mean that it is a small project or that it allows us to make small web pages, but when installing Flask we have the necessary tools to create a functional web application, but if new functionality is ever needed, there is a very great extensions (complements) that can be installed with Flask that give it functionality.

From the beginning of the installation we do not have all the functionalities that they may need, but in a very simple way, the project can be extended with new functionalities through plugins.

The MVC pattern is a way or a way of working that allows us to differentiate and separate what the data model is (the data that the application is going to have, which are normally stored in BD), the view (HTML page) and the controller ( where the web application requests are managed).

# What is a framework?
Currently in the modern development of web applications different Frameworks are used, which are tools that give us a working scheme and a series of utilities and functions that facilitate and summarize the construction of dynamic web pages.

In general, frameworks are associated with programming languages ​​(Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Symphony (PHP)), in the Python world the best known is Django but Flask is an option that may not have such a high learning curve allows us to create web applications just as complex as those that can be created in Django.

## Advantages of using a Framework
* It provides a project structure, that is, all the Apps that are built with Flask will have the same elements and the same files.
* Facilitates collaboration.
* It is easy to find libraries adapted to the Framework.

## Frameworks in Python
In the Python Wiki a list with the different compatible Frameworks is shown, you will see that some of the ones on the list say “full stack” which means that the Framework when it is installed for the first time comes with numerous functionalities or has almost all to make a complete web app, example: Django. There are others that are not "full stack" such as Flask.

# Why use Flask?
1. Flask is a "micro" Framework: To develop a basic App or that you want to develop in an agile and fast way, Flask can be very convenient, for certain applications, many extensions are not needed and it is enough.
2. Includes a development web server: You don't need an infrastructure with a web server to test the applications, but in a simple way you can run a web server to see the results that are obtained.
3. It has a debugger and built-in support for unit testing: If we have any errors in the code being built, we can debug that error and see the values ​​of the variables. In addition there is the possibility of integrating unit tests.
4. It is compatible with Python3.
5. It supports wsgi: Wsig is a protocol that web servers use to serve web pages written in Python.
6. Good route management: When working with Web Apps made in Python, you have the controller that receives all the requests made by the clients and you have to determine which route the client is accessing to execute the necessary code.
7. It natively supports the use of secure cookies.
8. Sessions can be used.
9. Flask doesn't have ORMs: But you can use an extension.
10. It is used to build web services (such as REST APIs) or static content applications.
11. Flask is Open Source and is covered under a BSD license.
12. Good documentation, GitHub code and mailing list.

# Flask extensions.
Here are the most used with Flask:

* flask-script: Allows you to have a command from the command line to manage the application.
* flask-Bootstrap: Style sheets for the page.
* flask-WTF: It is used to generate HTML forms with classes and objects.
* flask-Sqlalchemy: Used to generate the data model.
* flask-login: Used for user and password authentication.
Flask is an alternative to building Web Apps with Python, it has a good learning curve and can be learned very quickly.
